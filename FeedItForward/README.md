FeedItForward is a **community-driven initiative** that connects the surplus food from local hawkers directly to families in need. It not only reduces **food waste** but also ensures that **nutritious meals reach those most vulnerable** in our society.

This project applied **software engineering best practices** and **design patterns** to ensure high reliability, performance, and extensibility for future enhancements.

# Setup Instructions

## Frontend

1. In the `/frontend` directory, install the required node modules.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the application.

```bash
npm run start
```

And you are ready to start using the FeedItForward Frontend! The frontend application is running on http://localhost:3000/

## Backend

1. In the `/backend` directory, create a python virtual environment and activate it.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/activate # The .venv activation command might differ depending on your operating system
```

2. Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. In the `/backend/app` directory, start the application.

```bash
cd app
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

And you are ready to start using the FeedItForward Backend! The server application is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Database Seeding

If you would like to seed the database with pre-configured data, please uncomment the following line in the `backend/app/main.py` before re-starting the application.

```python
# app/main.py
# Uncomment this line üëáüèª
# add_event_listener_to_seed_database()
```

_Note: Please ensure that the `sql_app.db` in the app directory is deleted before re-starting the application._

# Documentation

# API Docs

The FeedItForward Backend application uses FastAPI, which comes with an in-built documentation for API routes created. You may access it via http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/

_\*Note: A total of **100 API routes** are documented._

![docs preview](backend/public/docs-preview.png)

## API Endpoints

The FeedItForward API Endpoints consists of 3 main category - `Controller`, `CRUD`, and `Misc`.

1. **`Controller`:** API endpoints for Controller specific functionalities as specified in the class diagrams designed.
2. **`CRUD`:** API endpoints for basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete Operation on classes saved in the database.
3. **`Misc`:** Other API endpoints such as file uploads and retrievals.

_Please refer to the the [API Docs page](#api-docs) for the specific endpoints and the required request body and expected response._

# App Design

## Overview

## Frontend

The frontend (React.js) mainly consists of the different **User Interfaces** (Screens), which are structured and categorized into **AdminUI**, **ConsumerUI**, **DriverUI**, **HawkerUI**, and **MainUI** as designed in the class diagrams. More detailed sub-screens can be found in the respective UI screen folders. They can be found in the `/src/screens` directory.

The `/src/App.tsx` is the entry point of the frontend application.

Other folders such as `/components`, `/contexts`, `/data`, `/utils`, `/schemas`, `/hooks`, and `/contexts` contains helper files that makes the frontend code more organized and easier to read for ease of collaboration (as recommended by the React.js framework).

## Backend

- `üìÅ app/assets`
  - Contains server assets like data files and uploads.
- `üìÅ app/models`
  - Contains the Business Objects.
- `üìÅ app/services`
  - Contains methods to create, read, update, and delete business objects.
- `üìÅ app/controllers`
  - Controllers that uses the various services implemented in the `app/services` directory.
  - They implements the Facade Pattern by masking the more complex underlying implementation details from the frontend.
- `üìÅ app/routers`
  - Routers that implements REST API endpoints for communication between frontend and backend. They allow the frontend to use the controllers in the backend.
  - Routers use the controllers implemented in the `app/controllers` directory.
- `üìÅ app/schemas`
  - Defines all the request and response fields.
- `üìÅ app/factory`
  - Factory design pattern implementation of the database.
- `üìÅ app/database.py`
  - Entry point to database that will store all the business objects.
- `üìÅ app/websocket.py`
  - Implements the Publisher-Subscriber Pattern via websockets for real-time text messaging communication between different users.

## Design Patterns

1. **`Strategy + Factory Patterns`** for Database Implementation.
   a. Refer to `backend/app/factory/database.py`
2. **`Facade Pattern`** via the Controllers.
   a. Refer to `backend/app/controllers/*.py`
3. **`Publisher-Subscriber Pattern`** for real-time text messaging communication between different users (websocket).
   a. Refer to `backend/app/websocket.py`

## SOLID Principles

1. **`Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)`**
   a. Different packages with different distinct responsibilities are created. Specific classes in each package are responsible for a specific business model or logic group.
2. **`Open-Closed Principle (OCP)`**
   a. The application is open to extension through the use of strategy pattern (database) as well as facade pattern (controllers).
3. **`Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)`**
   a. Numerous small and specific interfaces are used.
   b. For example, in `backend/app/schemas/consumer.py`, there are `Consumer`, `ConsumerCreate`, and `ConsumerUpdate` interfaces which are used for different purposes (Display, Creation, and Update).
4. **`Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)`**
   a. High level and low level modules depends on abstractions through the use of the interfaces (`backend/app/schemas` and `frontend/src/schemas`).
